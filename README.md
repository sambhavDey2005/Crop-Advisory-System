# Crop-Advisory-System

## Overview
The Crop-Advisory-System is a machine learning and IoT-based project designed to recommend suitable crops for cultivation in a specific agricultural area. Using an ESP32 microcontroller and environmental sensors, the system collects real-time field data to inform crop selection, focusing on Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India.

## Features
- Real-time data acquisition via ESP32 and sensors
- Machine learning model for crop suitability analysis
- Decision support for crop selection based on collected soil and environmental parameters
- Targeted recommendations for large agricultural regions

## Components
- **ESP32 Microcontroller:** Connects and collects data from environmental sensors
- **Sensors:** Measure relevant conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, and more
- **Machine Learning Model:** Processes sensor data to predict best-fit crops for the region

## Usage
1. Attach environmental sensors to the ESP32 microcontroller.
2. Install the system in the target agricultural area.
3. Gather sensor readings for real-time data input.
4. Process the data through the machine learning model.
5. Use the resulting recommendations to select optimal crops for cultivation.

## Area of Focus
- Currently implemented for the region of Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India

## Installation & Setup
> **Instructions coming soon:** Steps for installing requirements, configuring hardware, and running the machine learning model will be provided in a future update.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Suggestions to improve model accuracy, extend sensor support, or expand to new regions are encouraged.
