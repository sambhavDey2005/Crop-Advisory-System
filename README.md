Crop-Advisory-System
Overview
The Crop-Advisory-System project is designed to detect suitable crops for cultivation in a specified agricultural area using a machine learning model integrated with sensor data and a microcontroller (ESP32). The system primarily focuses on assisting farmers by providing crop recommendations based on environmental and soil parameters collected from the targeted region of Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India.

Features
Real-time data collection via sensors connected to the ESP32 microcontroller.

Machine learning model for crop suitability prediction.

Insights on the best crops for a large agricultural area in Kattankulathur.

Automation and precision in agricultural decision-making.

Components
ESP32 Microcontroller: Used for interfacing with sensors and transmitting data.

Sensors: Used to measure various environmental and soil parameters critical for crop growth.

Machine Learning Model: Analyzes the sensor data to predict suitable crop types.

Usage
Connect sensors to the ESP32 microcontroller.

Deploy the system in the targeted agricultural area.

Collect data through the sensors.

Use the machine learning model to analyze data and get crop recommendations.

Utilize the recommendations to optimize crop selection for better yield.

Area of Focus
The project currently targets the agricultural region of Kattankulathur in Tamil Nadu, India.

Installation & Setup
Detailed instructions for installation and setup will be provided to connect sensors, configure the ESP32, and run the machine learning model.

Contributing
